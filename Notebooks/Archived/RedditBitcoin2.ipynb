Explaining it does not seem to do any difference because as the original post claimed - you are not interested in learning. I am growing tired of repeating the same arguments over and over again when there are thousands of explanations already out there that are super easy to find.\\n\\nBut let me try to remedy:First, the block time  doesn't matter that much. After 2 blocks (20mins) with Bitcoin you can be fairly certain that your transaction is settled. To get similar guarantees with blockchains that have lower block time, you need to wait way more blocks. The point here is that the work is what determines finality, not how many blocks. 2 blocks in Bitcoin will have significantly more work than any other blockchain after the same time (20mins). So lowering blocktime does not solve the issue of final settlement compared to other blockchains.\\n\\nSecondly, lowering blocktime (or increasing blocksize) increases the size of the blockchain, which we do not want for many reasons. What we could do is set a blocktime of 1min and blocksize of 100kb. This would probably work but does it do any practical difference? To get a speed which is useable in day to day we would need to reach a few seconds, probably 2-3s. This is not possible with a truly decentralised and resilient blockchain. So instead of trying to improve things that doesnt solve the problem anyway we have developed a second layer on top of Bitcoin. This is how current financial systems, telecom systems and the internet works, so it seems like a good idea!\\n\\nThis system is called lightning and enables you to pay huge amounts of money basically instantly. Lightning is ready to use and if you are really interested try using wallets such as Phoenix, Breez and Blue Wallet. You can put some bitcoin in there and pay to any of the services already accepting lightning payments. The routing issues are solved and payment will be near instant.\\n\\nThe main issue here is not that lightning is not ready for payment, it is that every purchase with Bitcoin is a taxable event. Meaning that if you buy a cup of coffee with lightning, that will be a separate row on your tax filing. This is whats stopping bitcoin for payments, not the limitations of tech.\\n\\nI hope this answers some of your concerns.\",\n",

Second if all the BTC was bought and held it would become worthless because currency needs to be accessible for it to power an economy. It’s why gold standards actually always fail, not the other way around. Deflationary economics suck and shackle people and economies and make peasants and kings. Imagine your house going down in value instead of up as there is always less money available to people. No easy access to a loan for a car, education, home, just live off the scraps of BTC giving to you buy those that already own it all. Medieval economics people holding on to here because they want their currency to be an investment instead of investing in businesses that generate things of value like products and services that are paid for. Really comes down to everyone thinking they can put all their money in BTC and then live off selling it to others in the future. Well that is working out well for the people that have always owned it and continue to sell it, collect and resell it and whales that buy into the scheme and manipulate the market. People are literally destroying their own wealth trading BTC buying bits of it from the likes of Tesla while at the same time he claims he is diamond hands. He literally has lied at every turn and people keep blindly following him. The story and narrative of btc is constantly changing by the folks selling it and the dreamers buying it. It’s a currency, no it’s gold, no it’s just a goal to destroy the fed and collapse society so we can all live in blissful anarchy. Or it’s sold on the lie it provides privacy or sold on the fact that it is actually the opposite and everyone can see what you own and what you buy and sell. When you buy a Bitcoin it is like you are literally wiring money to someone, a stranger it belonged too through an exchange to obscure this fact and hope you can get someone to wire you back more later.',\n",

Blockstream has no power to stop LN transactions or nodes or any other part of the network as a whole.\\n\\nWhat you may be thinking of is Liquid which is a different sidechain. There Blockstream plays a more central role because they control the ecosystem of validators who manage peg in and peg out of bitcoins between L1 and L2.
